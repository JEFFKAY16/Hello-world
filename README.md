Hello Microverse Project

The purpose of this project is to introduce new Microverse scholars to Linters as an important code review tool. To begin with, I set up a linter(s) for HTML and CSS, making sure that all files that are not relevant be ignored by git. This was achieved through this process found here https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css 

To have a secure code base, I created a branch called add_html-css_linters where I had added an index.html file, styles.css file, and test.md file. Due to the nature of this project instruction, the test.md file has been hidden in the .gitinore file.
