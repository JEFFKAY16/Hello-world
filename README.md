Hello Microverse Project

The purpose of this project is to introduce new Microverse scholars to Linters as an important code review tool. To begin with, I set up a linter(s) for HTML and CSS, making sure that all files that are not relevant be ignored by git. This was achieved through this process found here https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css
